# graphql-multiple-endpoints-v1
This is my first graphql test on multiple external servers endpoints 

The idea behind is to fully take advantage of graphql and its advantage of adepting different end points. I been building data syncronize software for a while and graphql does everything I wanted to do for the past 10 years or more. 

This project will be serve as an example of showing off building data that have multiple data source relationships.

Below are a few things that you need to get started.

- First you will need to build the databases

- Second you will need to setup envirnoment for javascript framework under npm

- Third you will need to connect the database based on the sample files that were given and you are welcome to build your own.

- Forth you will need to test each of the database connections and update how you arrange your database type as examlpes are given within the database code files seperately

- Last you will able to run it off server envirnoment with my graphql server codes that I built on.
